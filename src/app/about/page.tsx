          From solving complex mathematical problems to crafting sleek,
          interactive web applications, I thrive on turning challenges into
          opportunities. Whether it's building a multiplayer game in Vanilla
          JavaScript or developing tested, scalable applications in Next.js, I
          specialize in creating user-friendly solutions that bring ideas to
          life. As a national mathematics and speedcubing champion, my
          problem-solving skills are matched by a knack for precision and
          speedâ€”qualities I now channel into delivering high-quality code and
          innovative designs.
